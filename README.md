# fifa renderz: get stats

## pre-requisites
- install python and pip
- clone this repo
- do ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install dependencies

### how does it work
- to setup ```data.csv``` with headers: run ```py setup.py```
- to add players: run ```py main.py```

if `py` doesn't work try `python` or `python3`

this uses https://renderz.app/ and webscraping
